2017 cad contest cada049  Problem A

Note: The offical website claims that the cic machine provides g++ 4.8.2 version.
      However, I found that the environment provides g++ 4.4.7 version only.
      Therefore, errors occured when I tried to compile the files.
      Can you upgrade the g++ version to 4.8.2? Thanks!

1. How to run  
   Run cada049 directly: `   ./cada049 F.v G.v weight.txt patch.v out.v   `  
 

2. How to compile  
   There is already a compiled executable file named cada049.
   Everytime you want to compile, please type `make clean` first. (important)
   And then use `make` command to compile
